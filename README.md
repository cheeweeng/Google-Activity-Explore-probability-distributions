# Introduction
The ability to determine which type of probability distribution best fits data, calculate z-score, and detect outliers are essential skills in data work. These capabilities enable data professionals to understand how their data is distributed and identify data points that need further examination. 

# Statistical tests
Use the empirical rule to observe the data, then test and verify that it is normally distributed.

As you have learned, the empirical rule states that, for every normal distribution:  

68% of the data fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean  
95% of the data fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean  
99.7% of the data fall within 3 standard deviations of the mean  

# Using  z-score to find outliers  
Detecting outliers is important because they can reveal two important things, depending on the context:   
First, they can identify measurements that were taken incorrectly. Second, they can highlight parts of the data that can be focused on to make improvements.  

# Conclusions
- Plotting the data using a histogram, then observing the shape, enables you to visually determine whether the data is normally distributed.
- The empirical rule can be used to verify whether a distribution is normal.
- The mean and standard deviation are important measures when applying the empirical rule to a distribution.
- Z-score allows you to identify potenial outliers in the data.
